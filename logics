// LOGICS

1 : If We ar Sorting, or Finding Max or Min again n again 
    to optimised This Situation Use : PriorityQueue/Heap
  
2 : If We are working with Subarrays
    we shall prefer : Sliding Window  or Prefix Sum

3 : If we are dealing with Subsequence
    we shall prefer : Backtraking solution then try to convert it into Head Recursion solution
    than try to Optimised it by Using Dynamic Programming

4 : In most of the String Problems we would prefer Stack Solution

5 : Always try to write a BruteForce solution than try to focus the Inner Loops
    and Brainstorm how this inner loop can be replaced with optimised code
    Example : If we add a Inner loop to Search than replace that with HashMap
              as it Reduces time complexity From O(n) -> O(1)
